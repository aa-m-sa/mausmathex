[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aa-m-sa/mausmathex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aa-m-sa/mausmathex)

My LaTeX template + other helpful stuff for math-heavy homework.
Originally packaged for the autumn 2015 iteration of *Introduction to Machine Learning* here at UofH.

Recommended way to compile is LuaLaTeX / latexmk. (See the handy Makefile.)
